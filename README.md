This code determines the strength of a password based on specific criteria such as length, presence of uppercase letters, digits, and 
special characters. It displays a success alert if the password meets all criteria and an error alert otherwise. It demonstrates 
password strength checking and usage of GUI alerts using the pyautogui and tkinter libraries.
